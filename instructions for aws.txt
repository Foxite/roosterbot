Here's a basic overview that should get you on the right track.

    Sign up for an AWS account (you need a payment card to be able to do this)
    Once logged into AWS select the closest region (top right) to the region the discord server you will be using the bot on is located.
    Go to the console home ("services" drop-down menu in the top left)
    select "Launch a virtual machine" underneath "Build a solution"
    Follow the steps. This will create a free tier eligible EC2 instance, if for whatever reason you use the advanced wizard only choose the free tier eligible options.
    When asked for Operating system select the one you are most comfortable with. I went with Ubuntu server but if you have no knowledge of Linux you may wish to use windows server.
    Wait for the instance to fully start (will take a few mins)
    Connect to the server. How to do this will depend on what os you chose. If Linux you'll want to use PuTTY If windows use Remote Desktop Connection (aka RDP)
    Once connected to the server install whatever bot you want. Again this is up to you, I'm still running RED and I'm happy with it.
    You're done

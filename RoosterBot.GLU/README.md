RoosterBot.GLU is a component that provides RoosterBot.Schedule with schedule data originating from Graphic Lyceum Utrecht.
It also provides abbreviation expansions for activities listed on those schedules, and some requested commands from users.

It uses [CsvHelper](https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/) to read schedule and staff member information.

RoosterBot.Watson integrates RoosterBot with [IBM Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/), enabling users to write commands in natural language, instead of having to learn commands.

The actual capabilities of this component depend entirely on the data stored in the cloud. It requires a config file that provides credentials to access an IBM Cloud account.

It uses the [.NET library for Watson provided by IBM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IBM.Watson.Assistant.v2/).

27-09-18 16:30: Started work. Building on top of the EchoBot to skip basic bot construction.
27-09-18 20:58: Got basics done, it can tells you what class you have now and where and by who, and what comes after this. same thing for any teacher.
27-09-18 23:03: Can now look up teachers by any name, including their abbreviation, their first name, and alternative spellings of their name. this is hardcoded for now.
28-09-18      : Can now look up rooms.
28-09-18      : Better error handling, and now adds a reaction when an error occurs.
28-09-18      : Code now a bit more organized.
29-09-18 11:00: Bot should now be able to determine a student's class based on their ranks. I need more users in the testing server to do a proper test, though.
29-09-18 11:58: Dropped that feature. It isn't that much more practical than giving it your class, and it's not particularly easy to do in the code.
29-09-18 12:04: Renamed project to RoosterBot (because that's what it is now).
29-09-18 13:18: Investigating Amazon EC2 as a potential VPS for this bot. This means that I'm probably going to integrate this with their libraries later on.
29-09-18 17:27: Project changed to .NET Framework instead of Core. Added git repository. Deleted Echo functionality. Project now runs on Amazon EC2.
29-09-18 23:16: Bot now loads config json file, eliminating hardcoded CSV filenames and auth tokens.
30-09-18 00:56: Made code more organized and easier to maintain without having to recompile.
30-09-18 11:24: Project now hosted on Gitlab.
30-09-18 16:17: Added !reload and !shutdown commands for the bot owner.
30-09-18 21:44: Added !dag command that lets you look up the first item for a weekday.
01-10-18 14:13: Bot now uses icons with minimal text for its output, following feedback from users.
02-10-18 14:32: Bot now alerts critical errors to an Amazon SNS topic.
02-10-18 19:59: Bot now detects when commands are edited and re-executes them.
03-10-18 17:10: Added !daarna command which tells you what comes after the last thing you asked about.
05-10-18 17:15: Info for students, teachers, and rooms can now be looked up through the same !nu, !hierna, !dag commands. Behind the scenes, these commands were moved into a "leerling" group and new ones were created that determine which one to call.
06-10-18 20:57: The bot will now delete its response if a command is deleted. This only works for the last command of each user.
14-10-18 00:43: Names for teachers are now read from a .csv file instead of using a hardcoded switch block.
14-10-18 21:03: Added !docenten which displays all known teachers.
18-10-18 17:04: Functionality split: All basic bot stuff is now in its own project, and all schedule stuff is now in its own project called ScheduleComponent. Interaction is one-way, and RoosterBot loads components through DLL file names in a text file.
18-10-18 22:31: Added PublicTransitComponent, which contains a functional !ov command which looks up train route data from the NS Reisplanner API. However, formatting is nonexistent and you can only use the station's internal shortcode. (Work on this component mostly stalled after losing interest in it.)
01-11-18 10:35: When the bot sees a user play slots with DynoBot, there is now a 2% chance that RoosterBot will join.
01-11-18 17:48: Added a requested feature in which the bot tracks when a certain teacher had last beatboxed. It is easily extensible and works through updating the modification date of files.

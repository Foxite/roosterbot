# RoosterBot

RoosterBot is a foundation for a multi-purpose Discord bot written in C#. It uses [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net), [https://www.newtonsoft.com/json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)	and [Ben.Demystifier](https://github.com/benaadams/Ben.Demystifier).

It has no functionality on its own, but it loads external assemblies known as Components. Refer to the folders in this repository for more documentation on each component.

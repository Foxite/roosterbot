RoosterBot is a foundation for a multi-purpose, multi-platform chat bot written in C#. It uses:
- [Qmmands](https://github.com/Quahu/Qmmands)
- [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json)
- [Ben.Demystifier](https://github.com/benaadams/Ben.Demystifier)

It does nothing by itself, but it loads external assemblies known as Components. Refer to the folders in this repository for more documentation on each component.

Technical documentation can be found [here](https://docs.rooster.bot).

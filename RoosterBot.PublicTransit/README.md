RoosterBot.PublicTransit provides a Discord interface to the [public API](https://www.ns.nl/en/travel-information/ns-api) of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), the public train company in the Netherlands. This enables users to plan a train journey between any two train stations in the Netherlands.

It is not localized into English, because its functionality is only useful in the Netherlands.

It only supports train journeys. The reason for this is because there exists an API that does support this, but it is a paid service. The NS API is free.

It does not use any libraries to access the public API.

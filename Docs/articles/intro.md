# Introduction
RoosterBot is a program that connects commands with a user interface, usually an IM platform.

Originally created following a joke on the Discord server for my software development course, the initial goal of the project was to relay schedule information to students of the aforementioned course - hence the name, which means "ScheduleBot" in Dutch. However, the software has long since passed that goal, and the software known as RoosterBot is now a highly modular, platform-agnostic commands system.

As part of the design, anyone can write extensions for the program, known as Components. This site contains instructions for writing your own components and eventually getting your own instance online.

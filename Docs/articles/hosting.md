How to get Your Own Personal RoosterBot.

## Official instance
You can get access to the official instance (which is running code from the master branch) on Discord or Telegram (as these are currently the only official platform components). To get this done, send me a message on Discord: `@Foxite#7366`

## Supported instance
If you want, I can create a separate RoosterBot instance and configure it to your needs, making you the sole administrator over the instance, and take care of maintaining it, which includes fixing bugs and ensuring uptime. I can even write components for you, although my services are of course not free. To discuss this possibility, send my a message on Discord: `@Foxite#7366`

## Fork and host
This project is licensed under GPL, which means you're free to create a fork of this repo and change whatever you like. Subsequently you can also run your own public or private instance using this code. I won't give you any support beyond any what any other user gets, if you choose to do this - you're on your own.

To help with automation, the solution contains code for two small executables, AppStart and AppStop. These will, respectively, start and stop RoosterBot. You can use these as commands in your deployment scheme.
